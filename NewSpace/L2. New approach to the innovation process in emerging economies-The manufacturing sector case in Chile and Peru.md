Theoretical model 
Business innovation-related literature 
- Developed economies, with less emphasis on emerging market, 
	- investigated isolation R&D, innovative performance and profit of the firm 

* Chile
	* Increasing R&D spending per capita 
	* Manufacturing industry
		* High relevance to job creation 
		* External factors, e.g.) price of minerals affected manufacturing growth in Chile and Peru 

* The results of innovation do not increase the performance of the sector, and the feedback effect decreases on the inputs of the innovation 
	* Circular model
	* Positive and negative feedback loops between internal variables, external variables and different stakeholders. 
		* Emerging economies, Institutions, Resources and capabilities are also relevant in the strategic process and performance of the firm 
* Identify significant explanatory variables that determine innovative behavior

1. Innovation detpends on factors both internal and external to companies
	* Primary internal factors include the company size, organizational structure, resources available for innovation, team management, and active and functional strategies
	* Size studies: Mixed result
		* [[Static perspective]]: Large companies invest more in R&D and Innovation 
		* [[Dynamic perspective]]: Small enterprises can develop capabilities that improve R&D effectiveness through innovation, possibly even outperforming large enterprises.
