# Upstream sector
- Public procurement for innovation (PPI) in the performance of the suppliers
- The literature on the technoilogical transfer which takes place between the space sector and the other economic sectors
- The literature on the link between university and industry which, in our case, is projected on the link between university and space sector 

* The space programs of public agencies, and particularly European agencies such as the ASI or the ESA, mainly define the infrasturcture scientific/performance/cost requirements in their procurement activity, and leave the responsibility for the technologiclaal project.

* The belief that PPI is capable of improving companies' economic performance and their innovative potential is supported by a broad economic literature
	* the contracting authority bears the risks related to investments in research&development and innovation 
	* Such risk can deter private companies from bearing innovation costs, which leads to a suboptimal level of innovation^[Mazzucato, M. (2016). From market fixing to market-creating: a new framework for innovation policy. Industry and Innovation, 23(2), 140-156.]

impact on High-tech sectors is higher than low-tech companies. 
Relevant technological [[Spillover]]

* The benefit coming from the partnership with research institutions/infrastructures and public agencies are not limited to the positive effects which may derive from the procurement relationship - **Economic benefit**
* Effect of partnership between contracting authority and research institution (public research body or university department is less easy to identify 
	* Academic research plays a key role in the industrial innovation process.^[Cohen, W. M., Nelson, R. R., Walsh, J. P. (2002). Links and impacts: the influence of public research on industrial R&D. Management science, 48(1), 1-23.]
* Metrics to empirically assess the outcomes downstream of the collaborative process between unviersity and industry^[Perkmann, M., Tartari, V., McKelvey, M., Autio, E., Broström, A., D’este, P., Sobrero, M. (2013). Academic engagement and commercialisation: A review of the literature on university–industry relations. Research policy, 42(2), 423-442.]
	* number of patent application, granted patents, publications in peer-reviewed journals, number of doctoral and postdoctoral positions promoted during the partnership, number of joint supervision agreements, number of new spin-off projects, number of interns
**Benefit of industry - Academy joint**
