FDA 1988, US Food and Drug Administration was shut down by demonstrators from the aggressive activist organization ACT UP(AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power)

- Draw attention to FDA's slow process for approving new AIDS drugs
- PPL from all populations, and all stages of HIV infection should be included in clinical trials. 
- ACT UP played a significant role in drawing public attention to the challenges faced by AIDS sufferers. 
	- vivid illustration of the ways that community groups can become educated about important scientific issues that affect them and then engage with scientists and government agencies to steer research. 
- Scientists & Citizens
	- Oppositional: AIDS case
	- Collaborate to design and perform research project that address community concerns. 
		- Community-based participatory research (CBPR)


Engagement btw citizens, policymakers, scientists, and other scholars. 
1) boottom up engagement btw community and researchers
2) Top down engagement elicit public input on scientific issues
3) interdisciplinary engagement, scholars with diverse personal and educational backgrounds
4) engagement with law, institution, and policises

values are not adequately presented in marketplace 
- 2/3 of scientific research in US is private-funded
	- what products people want to buy
- government-funded research strategy required
- low income ppl value matters
- products profitable not only consumers value but also government policies that influence whether they can be sold, and how mch they can be sold for. 


# AIDS activism and community engagement with research 
*Silence = Death*

# The effects of AIDS Activism on Scientific Research 
* CCC County Community Consortium
	* primary-care doctors provided drugs and collected data
* CRI: NYC Community Research Initiative
	* allowed AIDS patients to collaborate with activists 
--> FDA approved AIDS-related treatement based solely on community-based research from CCC and CRI (1989)

* ACT UP worked to change research and policy practices on FDA and NIS
* beyond staging demonstrations, and began educating themselves about the details of AIDS research. 
* 
- AIDS activists agitated for greater investment in research to address AIDS, influencing societal decisions about which research topics to prioritize
- raised concerns , topic under investigation
- More ppl participate, influence decisions about research aims. 


# Other Examples of Community Action
Community groups have engaged with scientists to explore the value-laden aspects of scientific research.

# Formal Engagement Efforts
creating engagement is to intimate it from the top down through organized, formal efforts. 

* Nanotechnology, manipulation of matter at the molecular level. 
* Michael Crichton *prey* (2002)
* Bill Clinton launched National Nanootechnology Initiative(NNI)
	* 2001~2005, $20 billion in nanotech across 20 diff government departments and agencies

* Researchers are studying new tech or topics that do not immediately affect local communities
	* No intense enthusiasm or distrust of new tech
* Social scientists and policymakers ahve explored a number of techniques for eliciting public input about important value judgements in scientific research. 
> 결국 기관의 입장에 맞는 교육을 시키게 될텐데, 이게 가치 중립적일 수 있나?
> ex) 원자력 

* European Commision provided funding for a project called DEEPEN (Deeping Ethical Engagmenet and Participation with Emerging Nanotech)
	* Issue or concern related to nanotech
	> 전문가 불신. 
	* be careful what you wish for
	* opening Pandora's bbox
	* Messing with nature
	* Kept in the dark
	* The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer
* National Science Foundation funded two centers for Nanotechnology in Society(CNS), 2005
	* gather public perspectives on the future course of research 

* Cirizens can produce very insightful and well-informed documents through this process
	* But, It is easier in small country like Denmark

* Increase the public's capacity for civic involvement
* influenmce scientific practice
-> This Engagement effiorts might be designed tio increase public acceptance of new areas of science and technology 


# Diverse, Interdisciplinary scholarship
**Promote engagement btw interdisciplinary groups of scholar with diverse background**
* Ex of Kristin Sharader Frechette, author on Role of ethics and values in science and technology. 
	* Worked to provide evidence of links btw community health problems and toxic-waste dumps or other sources of pollution 
* *Taking Action, Saving Lives*
