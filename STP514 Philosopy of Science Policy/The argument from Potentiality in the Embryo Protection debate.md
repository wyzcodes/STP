[[Potentiality]] (PA) : Babies have a full right to life. Embryos are potential babies. Therefore embryos have a full right to life. 

[[P-quality]] : The developmental potential in question. The "species argument" the embryo already belongs to the human family

**Argument from continuity**
In the development of fertilized eggs tere is no morally relevant cutoff point
**Argument from identity**
The embryo is relevantly identical to the later child 

Objective of this article is to argue against the ethical relevance of the P-quality and thus against the plausibility of PA.
