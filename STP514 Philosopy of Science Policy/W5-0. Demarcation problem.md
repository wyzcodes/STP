## Douglas: Functionalist
Industry funded science

Chem industry, with Holes evidence
- Consequentialist direct role. Interest of industry 
- Direct values 
- illegitimate use of indirect values
- revealing the negative data - Indirect and direct role ov values can be vary. 
	- Indirect - legitimate direct- illegitimate. 
	- Not distinct. 
Elliot: Avoid unpleasant consequences - directly intend to bring about good consequences. 
Douglas: direct roles of consequencial sense. 
	Dodge, cherrey pick the evidence. 
	 
* Models are in to industry or environment. 
* legitimating direct role of values, 

Deals the rigid distinction. 
- offer nice alternative. 
- Douglas view - direct & indirect roles, more general. 
- Elliot - cases. 

# New demarcation problem
dificult to fit the idea. 
How to fit different cases 

Legitimacy of values on case study. 

* move the inductive risk.  -> avoid inductive risk? 
	* how to deal with underdetermined data
	* two problems are connected. 
	* Two models equivalently supported by evidence. - how much error 
>Toxicology: threshold model. 

Why scientists bring good result, 
decision based on evidence, 
- what they believing, what they accept 
- evidence, 

Legitimate role of values, difficult to case study, 1970s 
Demarcation problem, legitimate and illegitiamte role of science. 

Scientific reasoning, 
- Constructive theory based on facts 


Koskinen, Rolin 
No quantiting science is used, value making, regulating pattern of environment. 
* are we expecting too much on science for policymaking?
* not most democratic decision anyway
