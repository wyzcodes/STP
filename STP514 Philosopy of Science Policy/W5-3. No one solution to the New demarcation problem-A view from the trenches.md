Hidden values 

[[W5-1. New Demarcation Problem]] by [[Holman]] & [[Wilholt]]

Illegitimate values sometimes embedded in scientific work and expert advice, 
Diagnostic side of the project

new demarcation problem is manifested in very distinct forms that deserve separate analysis and reform 

# New Demarcation Problems
* [[New Demarcation problems]] arise from [[Professional values]] & [[Ends-oriented biases]]
	* ==Professioonal value==: diverse, open-minded experts provide technical advice on policy questions, and their collective opinions and guidance are infused with hidden, but communally-held values that diverge from those held by the public or policymakers [[Douglas]]
	* ==ends-oriented==: actors conduct biased research that violates scientific conventions that compromise the delivery of reliable scientific advice [[Elliot]]
* Result
	* The indistinct and problematic amalgamation of illegitimate values with scientific findings and interpretations. 
	* Employ a plurality of skeptical peers
* Solution
	* [[Holman]] & [[Wilholt]] Five demarcation strategies
		* Wilholt: comparison of the values embedded in scientific advice against an undefined set of public values
			* Diagnostic approach: two-step inquiry that distinguish different types of illegitimate values
			1) Locate and appropriately qualify the ends-oriented or preference biased in policy-relevant research 
			2) Research with respect to how various values embedded in that communally-accepted reserach map against the relevant preferences held by policymakers, the public, and other stakeholders.

# Dual manifestations of the new demarcation problem 
[[New demarcation problem]]
*How to identify cases of science that cross a line etween the inevitable management of epistemic risk in the light of value judgements and an inadmissible distortion of inquiry*
## Professional values
* Science practice, with [[Value-laden choices]] & [[hidden values]]
### Nature of the professional values demarcation problem 
* [[Value-free]] 
	*Values can influence science in a variety of ways, including by providing the inspiration to pursue particular topics, by altering the questions and methods that researchers pursue, and by changing the amount of evidence they demand before drawing conclusion*  [[Elliot]]
* [[Professional values]]
	* The professional values are essential to enable scientists to bridge their observation to theory. 
	* Values are embedded in the practice of science. 
* [[Boundary work]]
	* Ideological efforts by scientists to distinguish their work and its products from nonscientific intellectual activities 
	e.g) IPCC
	* Values are embedded in their conventions, methods, and modes of interpretation 
* Public value system and the communally held values incorporated into scientific conventions and practices can become even more significant for certain subfields of technical or scientific research that originate specifically to inform social decisions. 
	ex) Forensic science

### Examples of professional value types of demarcation problems. 
* [[Institutional approach]] to science policy adopts an **Expert consensus** model of scientific advice
* empaneling of reputable, open-minded scientists in [[blue-ribbon panels]] to provide, 
* biases and values of individual scientists 
*What is known in science* in response to policy-framed questions. 

**Critic** ==Eventhough the panels can provide a reliable summary of mainstream science advice, they often fail to fully explicate the values implicit in their widely-accepted scientific practices.==

## Ends-oriented biases
[[Ends-oriented biases]] : scientific work that informs policy is not representative or consistent with scientific conventions held by the larger scientific community
* Divergent, *"preference biases"*
* [[Industry-funded science]]
* Policymakers lack of underlying conventional standards and methods of communal scientific insights. 
* Biases diverge from communal standards and shared scientific ideas
	* Blue-ribbons: Skip review for political and practical reasons
* Sponsor can **Cherry-pick** results


# Separate Two types of problems 
Professional value vs Ends-oriented biases -> **Mutually Exclusive**

### Professional values distinguish from science
* ==Collaborative decsion-making==
	* Serviceable-truths from science-public collaboration 
	* communally-held sceientific conventions 

### End-oriented bias in science 
* Violate scientific norms of open-mindedness, disinterestedness, and skepticism
* Framing, methods, and communication of research 
	* mandating the disclosure of conflicts and funding sources
	* peer review
	* open data initiatives
	* autor-targeted interventions

### Mutually Exclusive
**Solution**
* Ends-oriented biases: engage diverse experts to review 
* Professional value: Collaborative decision-making, representatives of the public work side-by-side with the scientists 
	* Collaboration can lead to ends-oriented biases
		* Value-driven sponsors
		* Cherry-picked 
**Fuzzy edge**
Collective group of repsected scientists 
divergent views on the question of whether 

==Well designed institutional structures can lead to more effective processes tht help advance both rigorous science and public values in social decision-making==

# Possible correctiveness to better identify illegitimate values in science advice
[[Science-blind approach]]
messy scientific challenges are put to one side, no longer an excuse for dealy. 
well-studied problem. 

## Separate and track the different types of illegitimate values
1. minimize the ends-oriented biases in scientific advice
2. Extract embedded values from the communal scientific analysis 
	*  Focus on public deliberations with experts to locate many underlying assumptions, conventions, and other features that might intersect with key public values.
