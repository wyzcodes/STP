Moral compromise
epistemically inconsistent but practically working 

hESC - moral compromise? 
we can use embryos vs we cannot use embryos 
Enthusiasts vs interdictionist 

- disguised compromise - corruption of epistemic testimony 
- inconsistent practically woring 

What should we do? 
- shold wehold an inconstent ? 
Gordon Massamba 

moral compromise? not find a compromise, but finding a compromise can also be unethical. practical. 

Specificity ofboethics 
- why bioetihics more cmplicated? 
- what is embryo? - don't agree on single defnition. 
- what makes bioethics special and dficult? 


- Novelty, Moral difficulty, potential benefits 
- potential of benefit, new technology that could brngabout 
- The cost of being wrong 
- what makes us human, what changes 

Argument 
- the corruption of testimony - hESC and iPSC 
- The erosion of epistemic standards
- Ethical and practical debate 

Compromise - how do we determine? who is ersponsible? 
Erosion of epistemic standards 

There is value in arriving at an agreement 
enthusiast and interdicitionists will agree - value in arriving at an agreemetn
- hESC research is morally significant. 

Moral compromise i nSCR - moral complexit, factual uncertainty, need for a relatively immediate decision or action, the desire to maintain a continuing cooperative relationship, scarcity of resources 


Should we compromise?
Are the arguments provided relevant?
why bioethics is specially difficult? 
Expanded to other cases of boethics? outside bioethics?
Influence of values in the compromise? 


iPSC - much cheaper. thought to be
Decision fund lack of decision support lack of decision to support party, stem cell research 

Analytical, complex but good philosopher. 
Douglas on compromises, iPSC itself - interesting development genetics of sulfatde

not really a compromise, introduce technology 
compromise position gives sth
iPSC not to retain compromise 


Technical solution - where this new technologies are gonna be used?
* Experts - compromises 
* How stem cell biologists made decisions of legitimate & illegitimate 
	* Create 
	* can do research purely for the research. 
* Reproductive treatment - ppl don't havechildren 
	* Reserachers are worried about the public - leftover usage. 
* One's that are needed, may not be good quality. 

* Enthusiast - don't think embryo is human. 
* Intradictionists - all embryos are potential person
	* Sum of agreement - less morally wrong. 
* Devolder - nothing wrong with embryo reserach. 


iPSC 

patent involved, very difficlt - go standard to checking the quality 
- good quality 
- devicive ethically 
- number of alternatives - nuclear transfer 


Turn any human cell -genetically compatible with you, 


Human embro - biomedicine . every stem cell line to make sure they really are. very difficult to do this. 
inherent problems with iPSC 
How you change them genetically, 

rector viruses - genetic manipulation: not the manipulation of genes 
significant proprtion of the cel

blood cell - reprogram it to become stemcell 

unreliable. - need to be checked against human embryo : quality control 
pro-sth - stem cell 

epistemically crucial. yo can't do ipsc research without human embryo stem cell 

what compromise look like? 
- arguing 
- Can compromise change? 

댄 브룩 - terminating treatment - no prospective 
still thinks it is okay. - policy makers or doctors. 
- not defending compromise. 

British history of bioethics 
- compromises may not achieved 


Practically feasible 
- practical problem, no reason in principle. 
- Not say you should do, imaginary scenario. 

Not makes compromises wrong. 

compromises worth, you are conceiding sth to the position. -- lead good consequences. 


Comprimise - with objective of less antiscimatic. liberal. 
- extremism. 

Very strong religious groups. 

What compromise is saying about us. 
Devolter - not rejecting, understand value. - 

Compromises may be folded - raise of higher values, justice or democracy. liberal democracy depend on compromise
Liberal democracy is most diverse terms of value. 
- moral compromise, Moral and political compromise can be separated. 


Relevant arguments? - philosophical things, view of ethics. 
the problems of compromises, 
paper was di드보어는 methodological & 
마스 크루지아 - not analytical, philosophical rigorous. 

Compromise is achievable. 
- Extract argument - validity and sound what the argument is, and whether it is logically valid, deductively valid. 
- Reconstruct the argument, look the structure - rules of logic. 
- sound - relations Actually relates to best science? iPSC is, : empirically correct? 
- Assess arguments empirically, naturatal case study. historical accuracy - technical details of case study. 
- conflicts of the case study - devoter strategy 
	- ipsc 

Reductive Ideal observity - take idea, deduce , to concluson 


empirical. depends on whether science  support the thing. 
inductive - 

Devoter - iPSC its implication, science , indirectly complicit. 
2010 wkfy - 자료 - Matt brow 페이퍼 ipsc depends on apsc, embryo. 

1. if the article is right, the stop all the research
2. iPSC doesn't stop hSC - didn't understand science 
Science has a logic. 

ipsc research - together hsc research. 
more and more ipsc stem cell lies 

role of complexity 

* Logic - assess through argumentation. 
* Are they really talkning about compromise? talking about two phases  of human stem cell  


Compromise? - benefit of health care very wealthy ppl. 
no early phase research. looks like giving up too much
* admit some of it, what makes policy makers dumb 

United states - 2001 10 11 George W bush - temporal ban of stem cell research by public fund. 
ppl can still use created stem cell. 
classic intradictionist view. 


was okay to use 

Moral explanation required to bush 
iPSC - any alternative sources of stem cell lines of funding. 
NIS - STEM Cell research 

Dickey - prevents every public funds executive orders. 

Master and Krusia - confusion in the model. 
some space for compromises. 

* iPSC and HEC - Indicating human membrane stem cell research. 
* Already there in the ethical discussion, 
* Devolder & Douglas paper: Ethics was always been problematic. - 


Creating the embryos
Disregarding the distinction


Compromise - both party give up something.
* Using leftovers - make even more expensive, and even does not matches the ethics. 
* Ok to use them, not ok to derive that. 
	* No moral difference using stem cell and deriving stem cell?

Enthusiasts use the stem cells, but have to derive them. 
* dubious distinction.  - no moral difference

Compromise can confuse the public and policy makers. 
NIS has used the distinction in this way, 

Funded research - 집에가고싶다 

Lost a case for supporting stem cell reserach 
stem cell lines - organisms. Research on stem cells. 
Reserach just on setm cells - what difference is it? stem cell lines sbd have to derive them. 

stem cell derive from public funding, moral dubious. 
what's the real worry 


Resulting the distinction - professional views to public 
policy maker - what really is a view of philosopher & experts

What practical ethics is? 
focused on resolving moral dynamics.  - 

If devolder is correct, no compromises ephishemic issues. 
Abstract on divorce from actual life. 


Legitimate to compromise, They do admit epistemic compromises, 
Correct view between them. 
some compromises are okay. 


Epistemic compromises have practical implication?
* politics - what makes any decision making in policy legitimate. involved, 

Stem cell debate again, where is gone to. collection of papers - changing policy

Science changed ethics. not too marginize conservatives 
- **politically legitimate.**
- How to legitimately resolve prblems. 

Republicans are in favor in stem cell research. 
Whatever policy decisions are made, epistemically better. assessing decision. Model of democracy? What's the model of legitimate?
What makes any political decision make legitimate? 
Using it directly. Implication of this world will be humilious. 

Short but importatn - bioephithesmic stem cell  - science and ethics tells about what makes policy. some way of including them to political process. 

1st is diff - move on. 
2nd short - dwarling on 
3rd diff
