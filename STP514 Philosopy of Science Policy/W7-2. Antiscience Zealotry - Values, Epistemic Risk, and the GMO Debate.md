# "Antiscience Zealotry"? Values, Epistemic Risk, and the GMO Debate
by [[Justin B. Biddle]] 

# Intro
[[GMO]]: Genetically modified organisms 
herbicide-tolerant crops, pesticide-producing crops, enhance nutritional content 
**Highly polarized arguments**

* Critics
	* Strongly enough to organize or march in worldwide March Against Monsanto protests 
	* Destroy field trials, Philipine activists in 2013
* Proponents of GM croops:
	* sufficiently passionate to accuse same critics of crimes against humanity - simply for criticizing the technology 
	* "Irrational and Immoral"
	* Norman Borlaug: Nobel Peace Prize winner, categorized "anti-science zealotry"
> "Opposition based poor people in the world must die before we consider this a 'crime against humanity'?"

* Ignorant, biased, irrational, or dishonest

* Liberals are just as antiscience as conservatives by arguing that anti-GMO views are not restricted to the political left, but contributes as antiscience
	* No legitimate reasons to worry about socio economic impacts on GM crops 

* Difference in [[Values]]
	* In terms of differences in how associated epistemic risks are managed, including [[Framing risk]], [[Power risk]]
	* Inductive risk by arguing that athere are numerous decisions and activists in science that presuppose value judgements.

## Key Points
* How the GMO problem should be framed
* Whether there are significant health and safety risks of some GMOs
* Understanding of the role of values and interests in science
* [[Deep disagreement]] aka [[Dirty disagreement]]

# Value in Science

## Shared criteria of theory assessment: [[Thomas Kuhn]]
