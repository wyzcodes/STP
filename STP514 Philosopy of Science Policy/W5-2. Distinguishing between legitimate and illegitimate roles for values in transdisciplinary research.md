# Distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate roles for values in transdisciplinary research 

"The [[New demarcation problem]]" [[Holman]] & [[Wilholt]]
*How do we demarcate between acceptable and unacceptable value influences in science, when we agree that non-epistemic values play an important role in all stages of scientific research?*

* New demarcation problem does not need to be framed as the problem of defining a set of necessary and jointly sufficient criteria for distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable roles that non-epistemic values can play in science. 

# Old demacation problem
[[Demarcation problem]]: the one where the aim was and is to demarcate between science and pseudoscience. 
* "The demise of the demarcation problem" - Laudan (1983)
	* Criteria that demarcate between science and pseudoscience had failed
* **Satisfactory solution**
	1. Identify the epistemic or methodological features which mark off scientific beliefs from unscientific ones
	2. be an adequate explication of our ordinary ways of partitioning science from non-science
	3. Specify a set of individually necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for decidign whether an activity or set of statements is scientific or un-scientific. 
* New approach to distinguish science and pseudoscience
	1. Science is a [[Family resemblance]] concept
		* no single feature need to be instantiated for the concept to apply, none of the features is sufficient by itself
		* Science is episthemically heterogeneous. 
	2. Descriptive definition of pseudoscience can suffice to clarify how it differs from science. 
		* Pseudoscience
			1) It pertains to an issue within the domains of science in the broad sense "The criterion of scientific domain"
			2) It suffers from such a severe lack of reliability that it cannot at all be trusted "The criterion of runreliability"
			3) It is part of a doctrine whose major proponents try to create the impression that it represents the most reliable knowledge on its subject matter "The criterion of deviant doctrine"
> Sufficient condition, different implications, logically. 
#### New problem of demarcation 
1. Preparing an open-ended list of principles for distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate roles for non-epistemic values in science
2. Develop context-sensitive ways of solving unclear cases

# Open-ended strategy to legitimate/illegitimate distinction
* [[Open-ended approach]]
	1. Collect an open-ended list of principles that can be used to distinguish [[legitimate]] from [[illegitimate]] roles for values in scientific inquiry
		* Provide open-ended list of demarcation criteria
	2. Difference between appropriate and inappropriate roles taht values can play in scientific inquiry 
		* How list can be used in a specific context, and possibly revised by adding a new criterion 
* [[Epistemic value]]
	* values that promote the attainment of truth intrinsically or extrinsically - Steel(2010)
	* borderland area between epistemic and non-epistemic values

## Principle 1. Non-epistemic values guiding the use of epistemic values
* ==It is legitimate for non-epistemic values to guide the sue of epistemic values, while it is illegitimate for them to override epistemic values when scientists evaluate and justify hypotheses and theories ==
	* non-epistemic values legitimately guide use of epistemic values 
		* providing reason to give more weight on epistemic values
		* Leading to interpret an epistemic value in one way 

## Principle 2.
