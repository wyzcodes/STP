Ch5. What if we are uncertain?

Ex. James Hansen, Global warming 
Values are relevant to scientists when they have to decide how boldly to communicate about uncertain scientific findings to the public. 
- decision: Whether or not to draw straightforward conclusiohns
- How much to hedge the conclusions with qualifications and uncertainties
- how to frame those conclusions with respect to broader social issues


Values are relevantr for deciding how much evidence scientists should demand in order to draw conclusions. 

Relationship around and argues that values can actually generate or contribute to uncertainty. 


# 1. Communicating about uncertain findings
## Case of Hansen
* draw public attention to the existence of climate change and its possible effects
* Value-laden decision
* Scientists have to decide how bolodly to present their findings. 
	* cautions and present in modest ways that minimize their chances of saying anything misleading
	* act like public advisers or even advocates and highlight the potential ramifications of their findings for the public 

* Hansen: 1986, congressional testimony, but no attention. 
* 1988, testimony - more compelling to introcduce legislation 
	* featured in media
	* Faced criticism 
* Critics
	* 1989, Richard Kerr, criticized. 
	* confidence of detection. 
	* policy decisions could be derailed
* Danny Harvey, other climate scientists were also seeking to communicate info in sodially beneficial ways. 
* Most climatologists agreed with Hansen, greenhouse gas emissions were probably contributing to global warming. 
* It was socially irresponsible, given the uncertainties that they faceed to make bold statements. 

## Case of Colborn and Kangas
* Theo Colborn faced decisions similar. 
	* Forefront of reconizing that a number of chemicals generate toxic effects by interfering with the ormonal systrems. 
		* Endocrine-disrupting chemicals were causing harm to humans
		* 
### Case of Patrick Kangas
* 1980s deforestation - tropical regions results in species extinctions. 
* 1986, presentation at the Fourth International Congress of Ecology
	* Vigrous dispute over the following two years in the pages of the *Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America*
* Critics
	* Reed Noss, influential ecologist, criticized for drawing questionable conclusions that could harm society
	* Other ecologists criticized Noss, 
	* **Come down on the right side of ecologically important issues**
	*
