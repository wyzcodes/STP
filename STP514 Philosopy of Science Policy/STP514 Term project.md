	- Military innovation diffusion 
	1.  Military R&D expenditure may fund institutions or researchers engaged in activities that enhance civilian innovation, e.g. universities being funded by R&D funds.
	2.  Defence spending on procurement activities can increase the demand for technology.
	
	3.  It can produce knowledge and new technologies that influence overall growth, as the existing technology base is utilised to develop new innovations.


4. Military ARMS race
	* Potential geopolitical implications
		* rhetoric around AI race broadly beneficial to society and self-fulfilling induce a race. 
		* Strong incentives to cut corners, such as bias and fairness
		* Consolidation of 
	* Industry-biased research: Public invested, but also the industry. Shares interests of industry and public
	* International regulation 


* Value-free ideal for science: AI on military use, Inductive risks. 
	* Autonomous UAV, SWARM drones may lead Man and Unmanned teaming weapon system
	* Internal problem of AI technology 
		* They do not provide evidence, they just induct decision 
		* XAI, Explainable AI is highly required in military artificial intelligence research. 
* Endorse the socialization of scientific research? - AI in use, patent promote innovation? 
	* Especially in IT industry, github and dataset are widely opened. 
	* Patent promote innovation?
* Dissent in science and engineering 
	* Dissents on artificial intelligence usage on weapon systems, AI war. Risk a matter of evidence or a matter of values
		* How could we communicate? --> Legislation on weapon system, 
* How should conflicts over environmental issue be solved? 
	* Political, ethical, aesthetic, spiritual etc. 
* What are the best methods to make public policies? evidence-based approaches?
