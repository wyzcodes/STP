## Five Types of Demarcation strategies
1. Certain non-epistemic values are employed
2. Some roles within the research process in ways
3. Have consequences for the generation of knowledge
4. Take place within a broader context that is more or less well-suited to facilitate critical discussion of them

Distinguish the problem 
1) Axiological
2) Functionalist
3) Consequentialist
4) Coordinative and in turn below

## Axiological demarcation strategy
* 가치철학적인 방법
* Legitimize the inclusion of values to mark out a set of values 
* Demarcation consists of distinguishing episodes of scientific research tat are shaped by appropriate values from those that are influenced by inappropriate ones. 
* [[Axiological]]: basic distinction underlying their crierion operates on the level of the values themselves
	* [[Kourany]]'s view: Ideal of Socially Responsible Science
	* A project that is first and foremost normative but to a great part also empirical, requiring an interdisciplinary effort of natural and social scientists as well as the inclusion of [[stakeholders]] and [[advocacy groups]]. 

## Functionalist demarcation strategy
* [[Functionalist]] analysis: Certain uses or roles of values in scientific research 
* [[Elizabeth Anderson]]
	* Legitimate from illegitimate uses of values in science
	* values must not operate to drive inquiry to a predetermined conclusion
* [[Heather Douglas]]
	* Distinction between [[direct]] and [[indirect]] uses of values in science
	* [[Value]] act as reasons in themselves to accept a claim 
	* *If values were allowed to play a direct role in the acceptance or rejection of scientific theories, an unpalatable theroy could be rejected regardless of the evidence supporting it.*

## Consequentialist demarcation strategy
* [[Consequentialist]]: Causal consequences on the generation of knowledge.  
	* To draw the line between methodological choices that produce a certain, distinctive sort of effects and those that fall to do so. 
* [[Krsiten Intermann]]
	* It is legitimate for scientists to appeal to non-epistemic values insofar as doing so will promote democratically endorsed epistemological and social aims of research.
	* [[Aims approach]]
