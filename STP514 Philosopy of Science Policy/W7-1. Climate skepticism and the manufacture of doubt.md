# Climate skepticism and the manufacture of duobt: can dissent in sceince be epistemically detrimental?
by [[Justin B. Biddle]], [[Anna Leuschner]]

* Epistemically beneficial and epistemically detrimental dissent
	* [[Dissent]]: Act of objecting to a particular conclusion, especially one that is widely held.
	* Dissent that not only fail to contribute to scientific progress, but actually impede(지연시키다, 방해하다) it.
*  Growing tendency of some stakeholders to attempt to delay political action by [[Manufacturing doubt]]

# Introduction
* Epistemically beneficial and epistemically detrimental dissent 
	* Beneficial & Detrimental in an epistemic sense.
	* [[Beneficial dissent]]: Contributes to knowledge production
	* [[Detrimental dissent]]: dissent that impedes knowledge production 
* Beneficial dissent
	* In epistemology, dissent is *Unequivocally beneficial* ([[Popper]])
	* Science is to attempt to falsify hypothesis
* Detrimental dissent
	* [[Policy-related reserach]] 
	* To delay political action by **manufacturing doubt**
		* Tend to delay poiltical action that could benefit society & Inhibit science progress
		1) Forcing scientists to respond to a seemingly endless wave of unnecessary and unhlepful objections and demands
		2) Creating an atmosphere in which scientists fear to address certain topics and/or to defend hypotheses as forcefully as they believe is appropriate
	* Epistemically problematic dissent in general.

# On what is not wrong with the AEI offer
* **Kuhn, 1962**
	* It is normal and epistemically beneficial for scientists to attempt to obtain specific result. 
	* [[Paradigm]] provide scientists with fairly clear ideas of how many experiments will turn out.
* **Lakato's methodology**
	* Negative heuristic: Research paths to avoid
	* Positive heuristic: Research paths to pursue, which help to save scientists "from becoming confused by the ocean of anomalies"
		* Epistemically beneficial to do so!
* AEI tried to 'buy' scientific result support economically beneficial policy 
	* Motivated by a political and economic agenda
	* *Economic stake 
	* Influential think tanks (AEI) that promote anti-regulatory agenda
* **Kitcher, 1993**
	* There are many situations in which 'impure' motivations - such as the desire for credit, fame, or financial reward - can be put to good epistemic use
	* Communities of 'epistemically sullied agents'
* AEI offer is motivated at least in part by *political and/or economic interests* does not imply that the offer is epistemically detrimental

* **Kitcher**
	* Motive to seek epistemic goals such as truth or reliability 

* Epistemically detrimental
	* Depraved motivations account of epistemically detrimental dissent 
* **[[Conspiracist ideation]]** : Tendency to endorse conspiracy theories
* **[[sufficient condition]]** for epistemically detrimental dissent 

# The attacks on Mann, Bradley, and Hughes
* The balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernable human influence on climate
* Human influence on the climate system is clear. This is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observing warning, and understanding of the cclimate system.
* *Hockey stick graph* 
	* Attacked for 'bad data'
		* use of Principle Component Analysis

* Dissent by McIntyre and McKitrick was deeply problematic
	* Violate the standard of ensuring that the data that one tosses out is, noise not signal
	* Easily dismissed by competent climate scientists
	* Used to attack prominent climate scientists and climate science as a field. 

> Isn't it rather a Denialism, Not a Dissent?

* Regardo's Publishment on Wall Street Journal - Treating dissents as Galileo
* Joe Barton, a conservative Congressman 
	* Raised questions about the *significance of methodological flaws and data errors*
	* Authority to compel to provide information 
* Many prominent climate scientists and scientific organizations responded publicly to Barton's letters, expressing their support & Concerns over blatant attempt to intimidate scientists

# Climate skepticism and its effects on climate science
* Many other prominent climate scientists are subjected to extreme attacks. 
	* Disseminated by conservative think tanks and newspapers
	* Dissenting studies 
* Epistemically problematic
	1) Forcing scientists to respond a seemingly endless wave of unnecessary and unhelpful objections and demands
	2) Creating an atmosphere in which scientists fear to address certain tipics and/or to defend hypotheses as forcefully as they believe is appropriate
		* Fear to draw strong conclusion 
	3) Waste resources
		* Political authority, powerful conservative think tanks
		* Stall important climate legislation, Moral obligation to defend their reputation 
		* Skepticism Not based on research

# Inductive risk and the evaluation of dissent
* [[Inductive risk]] to argue [[Value judgement]]
	* Play an ineliminable role in the evaluation of scientific hypothesis ([[Douglas]], 2000)
	* [[Richard Rudner]] 
		* To accept or reject a hypothesis depends upon whether the evidence is sufficiently strong, and whether the evidence is sufficiently strong
		* A function of the importance, in a typically ethical sense, of making a mistake in accepting or rejecting the hypothesis
		* If a hypotheses have serious side effects, we should require a high degree of confirmation before accepting the hypothesis. 
* [[Wilholt]] Example
	* [[Industry-funded science]] & [[Government-funded studies]]
	* [[Public risk]]
	* Industry-funded studies were [[value-laden]], as opposed to [[biased]]?

* Value-laden decisions
	* Raise the probability of obtaining a particular result
	* Violated a well-entrenched conventional standard

# The inductive risk account of epistemically detrimental dissent
[[inductive risk]], [[Conventional standard]], [[Producer and public risks]]

Dissent from a hypothesis H is epistemically detrimental if each of the following obtains:
1. The non-epistemic consequences of wrongly rejecting H are likely to be severe.
2. The dissenting research that constitutes the objection violates established conventional standards
3. The dissenting research involves intolerance for producer risks at the expense of public risks. 
4. Producer risks and public risks fall largely upon different parties. 

**Inductive risk account of epistemically detrimental dissent**
* Dissent to be an instance of bad science: Due to the violation of established conventional standards
* Not of epistemically detrimental dissent, we should not consider  it to be epistemically detrimental dissent because it will have virtually no impact on scientific progress at all.
