Iron Cage
rational actors make their organizations increasingly similar as they try to change them. 
3 Isomorphic process
1) Coercive
2) Mimetic
3) normative

-> Hypothesis about the impact of resource centralization and dependency, goal ambiguity and technical uncertainty, and professionalization and structuration on isomorphic change
Implications for Theories of organizations and social change

# Intro
* Max Weber막스 베버 - Rationalist(이성주의자/합리주의자) spirit ushered in by asceticism(금욕주의) had achieved a momentum of its own and that under capitalism, the rationalist order had become an iron cange in which humanity was, save for the possibility of prophetic예언 revival, imprisoned "perhaps until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt" (Weber, 1952:181-82)
* Essay on bureaurcary: contending that bureaucracy, the rational spirit's organizational manifestation, was so efficient and powerful a means of controlling men and women that, once established, the momentum of bureaucratization was irreversible. (Webber 1968)

* 근대 유럽에서 자본주의의 발생을 프로테스탄티즘, 특히 칼뱅주의의 교리 하에서 금욕과 근로에 힘쓰는 종교적 생활태도와 관련지어 설명함. 
* 맠시즘을 유물사관에 의하여 주관적으로 구성된 하나의 이념형이라 봄으로서 상대화.
* 여러 경제적 요인에 의하여 역사적 인과관계를 설명하는 유물사관. 종교나 정치 영역에서 행위의 동기와 관련시켜 역사적현상을 설명하려고 함. 

* Bureaucracy had spread continuously in the 80 yrs Weber wrote
* The engine of organizational rationalization has shifted. 
* Weber: Bureaucratization resulted by 3 causes
	1) ==Competition among capitalist firms in the marketplace==
	2) Competition among states
	3) increasing ruler's need to control their staff and citizenry
	4) bourgeois demands for equal protection under the law
"It is primarily the capitalist market economy which demands that the official business of administration be discharged precisely, unambiguously, continuously, and with as much speed as possible. Normally, the very large, modern capitalist enterprise are themselves unequalled models of tstrict bureaucratic organization"

### Now
Reason of Bureaucratization and rationalization have changed. 
	Has already achieved
Structural changes in organizations seems less driven by competition or by the need for efficiency. 

Out of structuration of organizational fields. 

effected by state and professions, which are great rationalizers of the second half of the twentieth century. 

Highly structured organizational fields provide a context in which individual efforts to deal rationally with uncertainty and constraint often lead, in the aggregate to homgeneity in structure, culture, and output

# Organizational Theory and Organizational diversity
Why there is homogeneity of organizational forms and practices

Organization history study
* emergence and structuration of an organizational field as a result of the activities of a diverse set of organizations
* homogenization once the field is established.

* Coercive isomorphism (강제적) by political influence and problem of legitimacy
* mimetic isomorphism(모방) from standard responses to uncertainty
* normative isomorphism 규범적인 associated with professionalization



쇠우리 iron cage
개신교의 현세금욕주의적 윤리가 퇴색하고 오직 자본주의 체제의 껍데기만 활성화되어 관성으로 굴러가게 되는 상황. 


1. 
Max weber explains human being life of capitalism in protestantism. 
From his book, The protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.

As a man grow up, and begin to earn money, he may actively accept protestantism that calls occupation is a personal goal of his life. As a protestant, one would achieve a selvation through the work. The most important value of this type of man is to earn money, so he think in rational way to optimize workflow with momentum of asceticism. 

Although we are not a protestant, in capitalism society, we would work in rationalist order to earn money, which has now became an iron cage. 
And so is the organization. To survive from the competition, organizations develop its system, and the bureaucracy, which even concrete the iron cage to individuals. 

돈을 벌기 시작하면서 직업을 소명으로 삼는 프로테스탄티즘을 적극적으로 받아들여 행복과 쾌락을 멀리하는 세속적 금욕을 실천한다. rational 자본주의 정신으로 살아가면서, 자본주의 정신과 프로테스탄티즘이 서로 연관이 있는 것처럼 여겨진다. 인간은 구원을 받기 위해 직업을 소명으로 받아들이고 열심히 살아가지만 결국 자신이 만든 강철 우리에 갇혀서 일생을 마치게 된다. 

2. 
Let's return to the article. Why author mentioned 'iron cage revisit' to explain organization theory?

Although old organizational theory questioned why are there so many kinds of organizations?, 
The article investigate why organizations are so homogeneous with each other. 
The organizations share blabla~~ that can be interpreted as connectedness, and structural equivalence. 

3.
The term 'isomorphism' explains homogenous of organizations. 
Iomorphism is a constraining ~. 
There are two types of isomorphism: one is competitive and the other is institutional. 

4.
**Competitive ismorphism** results when open competition exists. 
This is related to Weber's bureaucratization theory, which explains organization system is formed from rational ways. 
Since organizations share their components, Market competition~. are main causes for competitive isomorphism. 

However, the new institutionalism explains the

competition of modern world of organizatin. 
**Institutional isomorphism** 
explains, ~
This is different from competition, since many groups are already formed their system, and open competition is no more exists in old groups


5. Mechanism of institutional Isomorphism Change
Coercive isomorphism
Mimetic isomorphism 
Normative Isomorphism result by professionalization and structuralization.
