# Introduction 
* *"Wicked problems" - those that are complex, unpredictable, open ended, or intractable.
Wicked problems seem incomprehensible and resistant to solution. 

* Article adopt a hopeful stance in respect of wicked problems based on decomposing their challenging features into more nuanced categories and seeking to understand those governmental factors that make them especially difficult for policy makers, public managers, and policy scholars to addres. 
* Conclusive "solutions" are rare, it is possible to frame partial, provisional courses of action against wicked problem. 
* Explain and assess some strategies for tackling wicked problems, each encompassing a variety of alternative approaches. 

# The Nature of Wicked Problems
* Complex policy problems, in areas of risk and uncertainty emerged in 1970s
* Rational-technical approaches to dicision making, planning, and implementation. 
* ==*Rational-technical approaches* assumes the efficient and effective achievement of objectives can ==follow from adequate information, carefully specified goals and targets, and choice of appropriate methods.
1) *Perspective of Systems theory* : social and economic problems cannot be understood and addressed in isolation 
2) *Value perspectives* : social issues of modern life are grounded in value perspectives. Scientific analysis is insufficient to understand and resolve major problems (Rein, 1976)
	* [Technical rationality] (기술합리성) could not come to grips with the professional norms and practical knowledge of those who provide valued services to individual clients experiencing real problems.
3) Critique of *Expert-driven rational comprehensive planning*
	* *Pluralistic society*, not amenable to top-down general solutions
	* Social groups exhibit important differences in aspirations, values, and perspectives that confound the possibility of clear and agreed solution.
	* [Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning] (Rittel and Webber, 1973) 
		* Engineering approach problem solving has ended. 
		* Modern society is pluralistic, rather than homogeneous
		* Not enable to top-down general solutions. 
		* Different Aspirations, Values, Perspectives confound the possibility of clear and aggred soultion. 
		* Modern social problems are "ill defined", rely on political judgement rather than scientific certitudes.
		
### 10 Characteristics of Wicked Problems
1. No definitive formulation
2. No stopping rule, No definitive solution
3. Solutions are not true or false, but good or bad --> 결과론적인 이야기인지?
4. No immediate and ultimate test of a solution
5. Every solution is a one-shot operation. No opportunity for trial and error
6. No enumerable set of potential solutions,
7. Unique problem
8. Problem as a symptom of another problem
9. Numerous ways
10. no right to be wrong. No tolerance of failure

# Challenges of Wicked Problems
## 큰정부 vs 작은정부  
* The role of the modern state has expanded, and the proper role and the scope of the government.
* Reduce 'overloaded role of government', lower community expectations abuot the capacity of governments to address a wide range of major issues
* public regulation이 아니라 individual과 communities 에게 책임을 부과. 
* 더 최근에 와서는, political leaders determine to undertake large initiatives to address complex problems. 

## Dealing with disaster and crises
* Wicked problems to Prepare, coordinate, rapidly mobilize resources. 
* Nontraditional, Adaptive, Networked strategies to address nonroutine problems. 
* The argument that exceptional events, may require new types of policy response may be more plausible. 
	* [Complexity]
	* [Interconnectedness]
	* [Pluralism] 
	* [Uncertainty] 
* Emerge of Value difference (Roberts, 2000)
	* expansion of democracy
	* Market economies
	* International travel
	* Social exchanges
* No root cause of complexity, diversity, uncertainty, and ambiguity. 
* No single best approach to tackling problems.

## Fundamental cause of Wicked problems Example
**Stakeholder disagreement**
--> Solution: *reducing conflict through dialogue*
* Flavor participatory and dialogue-based approaches to goal setting, planning, and strategizing. 
**Insufficient knowledge about social processes**
--> Solution: *further research and data collection* 
* Fill knowledge gaps and improve the information base for decision makers and stakeholders 
==Problem definition imply a preferred solution. ==

* [Social pluralism]: Multiple interests and values of stakeholders
* [Institutional complexity]: the context of interorganizational cooperation and multilevel governance
* [Scientific uncertainty]: fragmentation and gaps in reliable knowledge
