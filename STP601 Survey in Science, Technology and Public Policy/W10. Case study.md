Case Study 

This week's articles describe the definition of case study as a qualitative methodology, and how to work on case study research. The definition of case study is an intensive study of a single unit for the purpose of understanding a larger class of units. The methodology is widely used in social science studies  for example, Maarja(2019) describes socio-technical system from the case study of Estonian e-participation system. 
Case studies have several characteristics: a) small-N , b) ethnographic, clinical, participant-observation qualitative method, c) process-tracing. The number of cases(N) can be vary, usually an intensive study of single case but can be comparison of several cases both in temporal and within-unit variations. The unit could found through time(type I), synchronic within-unit variance(type II), synchronic and diachronic within unit variance(type III). This provoke ambiguities that takes similarities from cross-unit study methodology.
Case studies are useful for forming descriptive inferences, apart from causal analysis. The study focus more on internal mechanism than external strategies. However, the limit is often found from the difficulty of original data collection, that makes cross-unit analysis harder than single case study analysis. Moreover, the evidence-based case study is hard, also to investigate based on theoretical framework.
