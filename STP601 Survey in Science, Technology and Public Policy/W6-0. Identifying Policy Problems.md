# Professor presentation

1. Verify a problem does exist 
2. Re-defining vaguely stated problems. 
3. Problematizing the problem 
	* Based on existing literatures, 
		* ex) transparency: why it important? 
		* What are the complicated values you want to identify in academic ways? 
	* Cosntructivist view, 
		* We don't discover a problem out there. we make a choice as a researcher, how we formulate the problem. 
		* Have to make a decision. 
* Problem requires a cognitive judgement 

* Iterative process 
	1. Identifying real-world problem 
	2. Literature review
	3. Developing research

+ preliminary research question 1문장. 

Why or 조동사(can)
* can, do, does - rationalist view. --> deductive, hypothesis testing
* why/how question - interpret, cosntructive view -> case study

How can you justify your question? As a researcher? How can you provide external validity? academic methodological perspective? 

- Topic의 issue. As a researcher, 

산안법? 
- AI Policy? 

- 산업안전보건법 

Explorative Case Study  - 결론을 도출하는 것도 중요하지만 future research agenda를 위한 프레임워크를 제안하는 것. 케이스스터디가 evaluation을 제공할 필요는 없다. 
- Revelatory 

* Systematic literature review
* Literature review를 통해 지형이 어떤지 알아보기..
* 전자정부 - 정부란 무엇인가 부터 시작함. 

- 데이터와 literature review는 다르다!!! 
	- 실질 정책 자료, 리포트는 데이터, 관련된 다른 환경정책 같은건 literature review
