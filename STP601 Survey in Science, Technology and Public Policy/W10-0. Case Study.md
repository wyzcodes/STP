* Case study methodology
* What is a case Study & What is it good for? 
	* by John Gerring 2004
# Intro
**Case study as Low regard as a methodology**
* What is a case study & What isn't?
	* [[Unit]], [[Spatial]], [[Time]]
* Unit: Organization, temporal variation, 'Diff from cases'
	* N-Question; 
	* Space & Time, at least two variations
		* As an assembly 
# Ambiguities
* Covariational evidence
* Intensively studied unit vs Adjacent units
* Combination of single-unit and across-unit analysis
* partake of two epirical worlds
* Status of a work may change
* Argument of the case study may lead further ambiguous 


* Causal mechanism vs Causal effect
	* Black box 개념? 
	* How, Why happen? - quali questions
	* cause & effect - quanti question. does, do? 
	* Independent variables & depedent variables 
	* Causal - Holistic 

Ex) 
- Qualitative research - both descriptive and causal, 
- Boundedness - why all nations fail, why these nations fail. 


# Inference
* How to describe casestudy to reader
	* Descriptive inference can be told as story-telling
	* in certain time frame. Consistent, in certain time framw
* What constitute good language - political science in language 
# Scope
* Breadthness 
* Cross unit study - causal effect & relationship of generalization power. 
* 2~3 max cases 

# Causality 
* Invariant & Probablistic 

* Ontological consideration: What is the value of case study?
	* Ideographic: perfectly unique
	* Nomothetic : Perfectly general 

* Case study - explans a universal view? nope. 
* Single unit & cross unit design as a complemeary 
* Explorative questions

* Unit of analysis - single individuals *

* Franco Fontana 



# Case Study Research: Design and Methods
Convert into research question?
* Research question, unit analysis, context, theoretical framework 

ex) 
* Korean public institutions - cloud system 
	* How or why not adopt cloud system?
	* What would be Pubilc institute in korea? 
	* Theoretical 기여 - specific field you want to contribute? 
	* Technology adoption, How public institution adopt technology 
* What questions: Exploratory 
* what questions - how many, how much 
* History, Case study, research questions


Linking Data to propositions
- Component that 

* Individual theories
* group theories
* organizational theories
* societal theories

Mill's Method
Method of difference -  
Method of Similarity - statics analysis를 활용해서 Parallalal 
- mill's method 
- Explanatory, Descriptive, Exploratory 
- Thick description - case study의 핵심 중 하나. 

**Research question --> Cases --> Concepts** 
Defining the case 
ex) Bitcoin as a case of cryptocurrency? value creation? investment? 

iterative processes for policy making - 


다음주에는 수업 없음. - 교수님 개별 면담 & 다다음주에 ppt 
11/14 ppt 
- Format 
- 7분. 5p 슬라이드 - 연구 중 나오는 질문, Stakeholder mapping 요청. 버블로그려보고 버블의 사이즈를 어떻게 표현할건지 생각해보기. 
- Literature review는 어려울 것. keyword를 생각해보면 좋음. 


Jargon: 특수 용어 
Social science의 level을 abstract하게 높히면 intuitive한 질문이 될 수 있음.
