A guide to Writing the dissertation Literature review

Quantitative data analysis: 2차자료를 수집함. 

Qualitative data analysis 
- interveiw, discussion, conversation 
- Qualitative data is different with qualitative research method 
- Robust backed up quantitative outcome 
	- How we can use independent variables. 
- 질적 연구가 질적 데이터


* 양적연구를 가지고 질적 연구를 할 수 있나? 

* Ethnography - Eurocentric view 
	* Etimology          q
	* HCI Human Computer interference
* Pragmatism base으로 mixed method가 가능함. 

Four different types of mixed methods

Sequential 하게 진행. 
- collect data in the field, and establish hypothesis, 
- and go back to field to test hypothesis and collect data 

* Quanti-Quali-Quanti 
* Mixed method section 

Research question depends, - mixed method 는 두 개의 리서치를 함께 진행해야 함. 

* Deductive reasoning: framework already conducted 
* Identify theoretical framework 
* Inductive reasoning: Don't know which framework would fit. iterative process. 
* Generalization - Key aim of quantitative analysis. 
* Qualititative analysis - is it possible to provide generalization 
	* Emphirical transferability 
	* Case study -> Socio-political context generalization. Socio-economic empirical transferability. 
* How many data is enough? 
	* Research Criteria 
	* Significance level 
	* **Validity** 유효성
		* internal - sample size change, to generalize. 
			* Quantitative data is genuine. - rigidicy를 제공함. internal validity가 높음. 
			* Generalization & Validity
		* External 

# Quanti vs Quali  Data Collection 
* Quanti - Theore testing
	* Generalization: Sample to population 
	* Regression & Statistical analysis
	* **Validity** - Data, regression model, hypothesis, 
* Quali - Theory building
	* Case to other case
	* Interpret research 
	* Empirical transferrability - Theoretical, conceptual transferability 
	* **Transparency** : Research procedure, originality, genuine, Content of interview 
		* Entire transcription of the interview - use quote for interviewee Consent form. 
		* Selection process of interviewee: **Snow-balling** process - Need to show the process. 
			* Timeline ----- 
			* Stake holder
			* Personal relationship
			* Academia
			* Gov
			* Civil
			* Firm
			* Conference
	* List of interviews 
	* Athrographic study - transparent for yourself. 
		* Section 1 - intro 
		* Section 2 - Myself
	* 참고) 국화와 칼 


* Methodological & Contextual 
historical & Socio-political concept of a field. 

KKB 1st section 
research epistemology 
from qualitative perspective


# Quali vs Quanti data rigidity
Quanti - robustness & rigor 
Quali - Triangulation 

Triangulation - more data collection from members 
1. Diverse stakeholder (Data analysis)
2. Different Interview, Focus of interview, observation, document analysis --> better robustness for qualitative analysis 
3. 
- Identify the research gap 
- scientific knowledge production 
- 1) incremental process: 

* You want a fit btw you reserach question and you reserach design, so that your findings provide an answer to your questions that is relevant to policy and the social science literature
* Make a specific contribution to an identifiable scholarly literature by increasing our collective ability 


* **Gap Spotting**
	* How can we identify the gap? 
르완다 - criticize by authotorism but, praised for economic growth 
NIS perspective & social culture perspective 

* **Neglect spotting** - No research has been carried out
	* under-reserached area, lack of empirical support. 
	* Political rhetorics, agenda ... 
* When you read, look for neglect of certain features! 

* **Application spotting**
* Identify research field - specify field. 


# Literature review
## Key features of Literature review
* Key theoretical concept
* Level of analysis
* Unit of analysis - hierarchical, relations
* sector, field - health, agriculture, environment .. 
* Stakeholder and their relationship
* Technological artefact - UAM, platform, e-governmetn ... STP encouraged
* Academic discipline
* Context
	* Time, region, country, target population 

## Journal engines
* WOS
* REF Program
	* Mendeley 
	* g2crowd: market share 보여주는 웹사이트.

## Systematic review 
* Master's thesis in systematic review? 
* Criteria in collecting literature, organize literatures. 
	* Not a summarize parallel. synthesize - intense paragraph of lit review 


Introductory sentence, Empirical research use of this technology - and refer to 3~4 major literatures, 
* economic perspective 
* Cultural aspect 
* Social context
* Political context  --> 2~3 references for the factor. 
* Korean case + international diffusion casess 

Then start specific literature review. Civic engagement, 
limitations of the literatures - empirical understanding of this and that Political participations
