# A stakeholder analysis
by Zsuzsa Varvasovsky and Ruairi Brugha

# Intro
## Stakeholder analysis
* [[Stakeholder]] Approach, a tool or set of tools for generating knowledge about actors: individual and organizations
* To udnerstand their behavior, intensions, interrelations and interests
* Assessing the influence and resources they bring to bear on decision-making or implementation process
## Purpose of Stakeholder analysis
* Feasibility of future policy directions
* Facilitate the implementation of projects
* Develop strategies for managing important stakeholders
## Aim of the Paper
* Discuss a set of interrelated questions to be considered before undertaking a stakeholder analysis
	* What are the purpose and time-dimensions of interests
	* What are the time-frame and resources available?
	* In what cotnexts and at what level will it be undertaken?
* Explain the process of conductingthe analysis, by literature & empirical studies in Alcohol policiy in Hungary
* Caveats and limitatons around data vaidity and erliability are discussed

# Preliminary questions
## What is the aim and time dimension of the analysis?
* Identify the scope and time dimensions
	* Past, Present, Future
* Past
	* Retrospective dimension 
	* (Broad) Comprehensive analysis on policy-making process 
* Present
	* (Narrow) Goal-oriented, Implementation of a specific policy
	* (Short period) Strategic planning to scan current, or predict the future organizational environment 
* Future
	* Prospective dimension
* Characteristics of stakeholder analysis
	* To increase the chances of project success through informing design, preparation, and implementaion
	* Evaluation, during or after project completion
	* The result of analyses can be used to develop project logical frames, and useful in identifying assumptions on which the success or failure of project outcomes depend. 
	* less complex and time-consuming endeavor

## What is the context?
* Understanding the culture and [[Context]] is necessary for deciding how to interact with stakehholders, collect and analyze data
	* Managerial, administrative policy culture & traditions
	* Ethnic and cultural affiliations make demands on politicians to maintain communication channels
	* Cultural and interpersonal communication can affect the success of analysis

## At what level will the analysis take place?
* Research levels: ==Local, Regional, National, International==
* Local level analysis
	* All stakeholders can be reached and interviewed individually
* Supra-national analysis (National & International)
	* Review of policy documents, reports and existing data

# Preparation
## Analysts and analysis teams
Analyst: ==Individual or team==
* Analyze & quantify qualitative data
* Team: Compensate for and neutralize individual biases
	* More objective
	* Perspectives of stakeholder positions and iterests
	* assessment of levels of resources
	* influence they can bring to bear
* Single analysts
	* More uniform approach in collecting qualitative data
	* valid cross-comparisons of data

* Analysts: ==Insiders or Outsiders==
	* Are they involved in the project? 
*Managers (insiders) can sometimes hold strong opinions about stakeholders which conflict with generalised perceptions of the environment. The external analyst can play a valuable role as an 'independent auditor' of those stakeholders.* (Crosby, 1992)
* Cultural insiders
	* Famalier with the local modes of verbal and non-verbal communication 
	* Good understanding environment and context
* Outsiders
	* Gain insight how their assumptions may be biase the analyst
--> Mixed team of insiders & Outsiders to analyse the environment.  

# Conducting the analysis
## Identifying and approaching stakeholders
* Identify the different components of the policy issue or problem. 
* [[Stakeholders]]: Actors who have an interest in the issue under consideration. 

## Data collection methods and data
* Data collection methods
	1) Face-to-Face interviews
		* Semi-structured interview
		* Contemporaneous note-taking
	2) Published and unpublished documents, reports, policy statements, internal regulations of organization
		* Interviews provide opportunity to access unpublished documents
> 인터뷰를 통한 데이터 수집 방법은 인터뷰 대상 표본 설정, 인터뷰어, 인터뷰 질문 구성 등에 따라 영향을 받기 쉬운 구조로 예상된다. 또한, 인터뷰 방법은 단체장보다는 단체 소속 개인에게 접근하기 쉬운 방식으로, 공식적인 의견의 확보보다 개인의 경험과 생각을 듣는 것에 치중되어있다. 인터뷰어의 bias에 의한 영향보다 기관 내부 culture와 context의 영향으로 정확한 결과가 나오기 어렵다. 따라서, 인터뷰어의 역량에 따라 데이터의 퀄리티가 크게 영향을 받을 것이다. 
> 반면, 출판된 문서, 내부 규범, 리포트 등의 문헌 조사는 공식적인 데이터를 수집할 수 있어 보다  명확하고 신뢰할 수 있는 정보를 수집할 수 있다. 하지만, 비공식적인 자료나, 기관 내부 보안 문제가 엮여있는 경우에는 내부 자료를 수집하기 어려운 문제가 도사한다. 

# Organizing and analyzing data
* Outputs
	* Constructed to quantify stakeholder interacts 	
* Feedback
	* Build trust and enable to correct & qualify 
	* Cons: influence and later the stakeholder's position, reducing the utility of the analysis
## Present findings (Output)
* Characteristics of stakeholders 
	* ex) matrix tables or map
	* Involvement, Interest, Influence, Position, Impact ... 
	* Levels of influence and support 
		* Changes in time-line
* Short-term pragmatic goal: Implementation of policy, Identification and assessments 
## Using the finidngs
* Identify the optimal strategies for managing other stakeholders, 
* Identify current and future opportunities and threats'
* Strategies of stakeholders
	* Supportive - Involve
	* Mixed - Collaborate
	* Non-supportive - Defend
	* Marginal - Monitor

# Limitations, Validity, and Reliability
* The environment, the cotnext of the analysis, stakeholder interests, positions, alliances, and influence changes over time.
* The analyst should consider:
	* The position of a respondent in an organization
	* How stable or provisional that position may be
	* Responses reflect individual views which may contradict or run counter to those of the organziation 
	* The degree to which a stakeholder has implicit or covert position on an issue
> Stakeholder analysis 결과물이 stakeholder 기관의 방향성을 제시하기 위한 역할을 수행할 수도 있지만, 각 기관의 개인에게 영향을 주어 organizational culture & context의 변화에도 기여할 수 있을 것으로 생각된다. 본 논문은 정확한 분석을 하기 위한 방법론을 제시했지만, 어떻게 연구 결과를 publish하고, 분석 대상인 기관에 배포하여 response를 이끌어낼 수 있는지에 대한 논의도 함께 진행되어야 한다.
