# Innovation Mantra
* Stylized facts in the innovation status?
* Innovation & Growth 
	* New growth theory 
	* AK Model: Y=AKalpha L(1-alpha)
	* remnent Exopgenous growth inputs considered. 
		* For same hours of labor, have to maintain effectiveness conversion. 
		* Same input, more efficient output 
* ICT & AI applied problem solving 
	* How we can develop complementary assets&use is imp. 

Henry Ford: "I invented nothing new, "  -- right moment of time, where every components are ready. 
Where the good ideas comes from 

* We have all hunches
	* Connectivity
	* Assessment of technological terms? 
	* rate of innovation - Unsatisfied factors.. 

Artemis - not inspiring as much as 1960s. 
- typical challenge, but nothing new. Technological breakthrough is to test again. 
- Mars project, 

2. Innovation comes from new combination
3. Innovation is pervasive throughout the economic system. 
	* Innovation in technology, 
	* 빌바오 구겐하임 미술관 - 카티아를 쓰진 않았을테고, 유체적으로 분석해서 만들었음. 비행기 제작하는 모델로 계산했다고 함.. - 완공년도가 언제인지 궁금하네... 
* Pace of Innovation 
	* Leading technology in 5yrs is imp. In Korea
	* Most workers ever experience a revolutionary change in their lifetime. 
		* Computer meant Human 
* Innovation doesn't mean Radical & Revolutionary changes
* GPT(General Purpose technoogies)
	* Synthetic nitrogen - revolution food production 
	* Information technology
* Source and Timing of a radical innovation are unpredictable 
* Lindbergh - atlantic ocean crossing 
* Germany: East & West differences in women career breaks. 


# Tracing Innovation 
* National Research Foundation
	* Ex-ante : Promising / Not
	* Ex-post: Promising / Not
* 사전/사후 분석 
	* Exdonous factors & Internoous factors

* Tracing Innovation 
	* Understand the status quo
	* Hard to evaluate 
		* Technology readiness; Not technology itself, 

Innovation is Relational. Combination among people. 

Creativity is critical to invention, 
* nature vs nurture debate 
* Many ideas are not useful. 
	* Patent: Idea must be novel, It must be useful. 
	* Key feature of innovation: not necessary be novel, but useful. 
* Marshmallow vs Polaroid 
	* Delayed gratification, (Mischel, et al 1989)
	* sustain temptation & wait for gratification --> optain reward?
	* Algorithmic & Heuristic task 
		* Out of motivation? money, goals,... 
		* Successful commercialization for innovation 


# Product Life Cycle (PLM)
* Fluid stage: Firms invest 
* Transitional stage: A dominant product design emerges, while not necessarily the highest performing product
* Specific stage: The product becomes a commodity and concerns about production cost are dominant resultign in innovation activities to optimize process technologies


# Geography of innovation 
* innovation in terms of geography is not random. 
* Knowledge clusters, they can afford. 
* Organizational routines are important
	* Open space -- Gone. 
	* Open innovation doesnt mean 100% openness 
* 80/20 policy -- Gmail. many things, --> 이제는 startup으로 분사하지 않나? PR device of 
	* Where innovation comes? How it takes place? How it cooked whitin organization. 


1960s US DOD 25% were spent for basic research. 
- where innovation come from? --> scientists contributed when they were driven by missions. Initial discovery and final application was shortest when the scientest worked in areas target by the sponsor. 
- Basic research 

US NRF TRACES
* How log it took? 
* False criticis, 


Mission, Project, Program,
