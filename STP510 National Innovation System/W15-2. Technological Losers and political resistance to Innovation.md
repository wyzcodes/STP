* Cardwell's Law: How and Why national innovation rates. 
* If a nation wants to improve its science and technology(S&T) performance, then its government must act to solve both market failures and network failures. 
* Institutions, policies, and networks explain how nations innovate, but not why. 
* "Fix markets and create networks" --> Why do some governments create and support markets and networks for S&T better than others?
