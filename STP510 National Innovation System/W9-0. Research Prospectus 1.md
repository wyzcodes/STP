cluster munitions 
Defense industry Characteristics
* Bilateral Monopoly
* Regulatory industry
* Large Investment, fixed costs
* Technology intensive
> 이게 관련 있는 얘긴지잘 모르곘음. Signaling theory - third party has low bias. 

Hanhwa - cluster munition manufacturer
global defense giants
- 업체들의 M&A 등을 확인해야하지 않나? 

Convention on Cluster munition - CCM 
* prohibits cluster munition bombs 
* 기후협약 등의 다른 국제조약을 확ㅇ니해 보는게어떰?
Responsible investment 
- investment principle 
- 한화defense ESG, cluster munition 섹터를 팔았음. 

* Interviews and archive surveys 
	* 업체에 대한 연구가 될 것 같음...

- what is the role of state-driven innovation? how effective?

* Russia has a monopoly on HALEU - 
	* Uranium enrichment 
* State -level innovation 
	* on development of science engineering and technologies in the field of use 
* Innovative directions 
* Motivation & Relevance

* States are not imoprtant(x)  What exactly is the entrepreneurship? 
* Can we really consider nuclear energy? - whe we findout link? russia is really a entrepreneur state? government initiaves. 
* objective assessment of state level innovations. 
	* PR material coming out of the data, 
* How can you access all the data? 
* What lessons can be learned from innovations? 
	* How can you define entrepreneur? 
* Why in particular domain acting like entrepreneur?
