# Locked in decline? On the role of regional lock-ins in old indutrial areas 
by Kevin 

Cluster: act as barriers by 'path dependence and lock-ins'
- Restructing processes of different regions
	- South Korea & Germany
	- Textile, Shipbuilding industry 
- Regional lock-ins in old industrial areas: a theoretical framework
- Lockin
	1) Functional: inter-firm relationships
	2) Cognitive: staying loyal to status quo, 
	3) Political: Thick institutional tissues taht act against restructuring 
* Prominent business 

# Putting the case studies in context
## Case-Studies Industry
* Shipbuilding: high spatial concentration global industry, high voernment intervention, high entry/exit barriers. 
* Textile: lower spatial concentration, entry/exit barriers and sunken costs

Korea - development state model
Germany - associative model 

* Industries
* Countries

## Shipbuilding Region Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
**privatization**
production quota 
a noisy restucturing process
## Shipbuilding Region Gyeongnam
**Ulsan**
Regional cluster 
* Cognitive lock-in: underestimation of a China as a threat
* Functional lock-in: high dependencies among suppliers and yards
## Textile Westmunsterland
* Naturally formulated 70s century. old traditional based on textiles. 
* Weak lock-ins allowed renewal and quite restructuring process

## Textile industry region Daegu
Export oriented textile cluster -> Automation, overproduction, overseas competition --> relocation of producers to China, Indonesia, vietnam ... -> trap of low value added production -> unsuccessful Milano project. 

Strong functional, cognitive, and political lock-ins fiercely resisetd renewal. 

Theoretical framework based on case studies 
cognitive lock-in

Lock-ins? Adjustment process 
non-tourism 

Transition, not a development
Regional decline, even Regional extinction 
zero-sum game - regional specialty? 
--> smart education project 
Regional government budget is automatically given, competitive project funding.
