The Geography of Innovation: Regional Innovation Systems
손의범

# Globality vs Regionality 
innovative activity is not uniformly or randomly distributed across the geographical landscape

* More geographically clusted 
* Tacit knowledge
	* Basis of global competitive mass

## Analytical & Synthetic knowledge
Synthetic: customer and supplier interaction
Analytical kowledge: scientific knowledge, university-industrial network 

Analytical knowledge base
1) knowledge spillover effects measuerd by indicators such as patent citations
	- patents more often cite others arisingin the same city
2) Star scientist - startup around the area increases

* Quickly and easily occuron local networks 
* Good for hiering highly educated workers
* employers want to work in high-level city
	*  사천 vs 판교 

Innovation System 
	Regional innovation system - analytical knowledge based industries rely 


# Rational Innovation System
Freeman, Lundvall, Nelson 
national innovation system concept 

* Evolutionary econommic theory
* Industrial district concept
* Theorizing of rationalization strategies 
* Governance concept 


Types of RIS
1) Territorially embedded regional innovation system
2) Regionally networked innovation system - analytic knowledge 
3) Regionalized NIS

Relation btw RIS & NIS
Traditional IRIS: synthetic knowledge
NEIS: entrepreneurial regional innovation system 

Alternative: communities of practice
RIS is not mandatory, 


Why analytical knowledge based industries connect? 
- Knowledge about failure is unshared, not published usually. 
- innopolis
