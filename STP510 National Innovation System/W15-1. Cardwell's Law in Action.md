# Cardwell's Law in Action
* Why some countries innovate more?
* S&T had fairly low priorities throughout most of human history
	* The connection between science and technology was not broadly recognized before the late nineteenth century 
* Modern economic thought: practically define new science and technology
	* Most societies realize that S&T can vastly improvve their standards of living, economic competitiveness, and physical security 
* Most government felt that they had little duty or ability to promote innovation
	* S&T progress is a random occurrence, a product of luck, not policy
	* National interests
	* After WWII, gov have come to believed they can, and should do something positive about national innovation rates. 
* How easy it has become to innovate --> Location should not matter
	* Globalization 
	* Transportation
	* Communication 
# What needs Explaining?
* Technologically disparity countries
* Consumption than production
	* Many countries can afford to buy cutting-edge S&T, but they cannot create it
	* Factories that produce exports or often set up and run by foreigner. 
* National innovatinon rate, look at S&T creation instead of consumption 
	* National patent data
