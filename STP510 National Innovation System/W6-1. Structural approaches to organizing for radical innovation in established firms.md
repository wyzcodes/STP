# Structural approaches to organizing for radical innovation in established firms
by Ana Luiza De Araujo Burcharth and John Parm Ulhoi

* [[Technological innovation]] has been widely recognized as a promising vehicle for continued wealth creation and sustainable competitive advantage.
	* [[Radical innovation]]: Innovation based on a technology that requires knowledge, information and expertise that are considerably different from the existing resources of the firm. 
		* Key driver of companies [[Revitalization]] and [[Expansion]]
		* Organizational and admintistrative innovations are recognized --> but focus is explicitly on Technological innovation
		* Emerge in high-tech start-ups
			* Established firms are to produce incremental innovations
* [[Conventional solution]]
	* to incubate and grow radical innovations outside the existing company, thereby creating physically separated dual structures that can accommodate the contradictory logics of exploration and exploitation 
* Reintegration 
	* When the product has already reached the market. 
* [[Conventional wisdom]] 
	*Which structural solutions can support the development of radical innovations in established companies and in which contexts such structures are feasible?*
	* To identify and discuss approaches to organizing radical innovation that do not neccessarily involve separation from the mother company and that relate to critical contextual issues 
	* Structural approaches
	
# Management research on the interaction between structure and innovation 
* Organizational structures on firm innovativeness
	* Radical & Incremental innovation 
* [[Incremental innovation]]
	* Continuous and incremental improvements better tmatch hierarchical strucdtures
	* Well defined roles and responsibilities, highly formalized work processes and relatively short time horizons. 
* Radical innovation
	* Loose and decentralized: Organic
	* Flexibility and long-term orientation 
* Structural solution to [[Ambidexterity]]
	* Resolves old **Flexible vs efficient** dillema
	* Creating isolated, autonomous teams that reduce the capability-rigidity drivers of mature companies
		* shunkworks
		* spin-outs
		* corporate venturing
	* Critics: Radical innovation that do not necessarily include separation from the mother company
* [[Punctuated equilibrium]]
	* [[Exploration]] 탐구 and [[Exploitation]] 개발
		* Two activities compete for the same pool of resources and require different mindsets and processes, and are therefore **mutually exclusive**
	* Punctuated equilibrium
		* Organizations temporarily move through cyclels of exploration and exploitation
		* Balance at the macro level via market and non-market mechanisms

Existing conventional firms. 
* Other alternatives, creating separate entity?
	* 삼성 C-lab
	* How radical innovation disrupting? Well established firms success, they don't actually need radical innovations, they don't need new possibilities? 
* Context: technological market

very practical reading. one of the top management journals 
--> not purely acadenuc
