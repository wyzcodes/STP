# Science communications
* Relation between Science & Public
	* Public attitudes toward S&T
	* Public participation in science policy-making
	* Community engagement;
	* Media communication of S&T
	* Relations with media and journalists
	* Scientsits practices and drives of public communication 
	* Institutional science communication/marketing/PR

--> Multidisciplinary: STS, sociology, social psychology, science policy, Public Understanding of Science ... 

# The changing structure of Science Communication in Society 
Theory & Practice
* Scientists, 
* Journalists, Science writers, Media based
* Institutions: Public RElations, Public Affairs, Marketing
Practitioners & Scientists
- Different roles in science communmication. They should be distinction. 

## Models of Science Communication - PUS&PE
[[PUS]]: [[Public Understanding of Science]]
PE: [[Public Engagement]]
* People relate to science 
### 1st Phase: Call for Mobilisation for PUS 
* Empirical surveys US/Europe (1970s, 80s) : 1st survey btw science and public
	* National science foundation of America
		* High levels of interests
		* Low levels of scientific knowledge 
		* Attitudes positive
			* Attentive(20) Interested(20) **Residual(60) 기타** - less lvl of knowledge, interest
	* UK: Royal Society of London(1985) **'Public understanding of Science' report**
		* Problematic around PUS, Low lvl Knowledge 
		* ==Urgent Message: Scientists must learn to communicate with the public, be willing to do so and consider it your dutiy to do so==
* Rise 'PUS Movement'
	* Funding for outreach, grants people to communicate, prizes, training for scientists, requirements in scientific proposals, **funding for research**

## 2nd Phase: Call for Mobilisation for Public Engagement (PE) & Dialogue 
* UK : Science in Society report (2000) - new way of thinking about science communication
* ==Need for dialogue & Opportuniteis for the public to engage with science and policy-making & Scientists to listen and learn from the public ==
	* One way -> Dialogue change
* Growing interest from various actors in involving participatory apporoaches,
	* Controversies, BBSRC bioenergy dialogue, GMO debate
	* How to put into practice 

- Relation between science & Public
	- Broader scene

## Mobilisation(동원) for PE
The mobilisation for PE has occurred at several levels
* Policy
	* Government, funders, scientific organizations, missions, PE Policies)
* Central level
	* Rise for PR offices, communications, marketing departments media relations
* Messo Level
	* RIs(Research institutes within Univ), Units, Centres (RIs) - independent from central 
* Individual scientists(micro-level)
	* Behaviours and practices

# Scientists as Science communicators
## Insights from a survey of astronomers and climate scientists
* Astronomers 
	* IAU 10,000 members in 96 countries
* Climate scientists: American Geophysical Union (AGU)

* Communicators vs non-communicators
* Q: Have you undertaken any public communication activities for the non-specialist public in the past 12 monts? 
	* What types of Activities?
		* public lecture, talks at school, open days, exhibitions, event by local organization, policy-making, ... 
		--> All One-Way communications
		* Discussion Involve, but not in Decision involved. 

* What influences a scientists' participation in PE? 
	* How Individual and Contextual factors play when together
