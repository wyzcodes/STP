Prof. Olivier de Weck

* Technological revolution on the earth
# Aeronautics 
* Progress of technology 
- A350 ULR: Ultra Long Range - 20hrs flight airplane. SIN Airline이 최초로 가져갔음. 
- Chess board - payload(passenger) & range graph of aircraft 
	- Revenue passenger kilometrer(RPK) = 21 pax * 1400km 
- Back to fundamental question: Breguet Range Equation
	- SFC: Specific fuel consumption 
	- units 
- Progress in Engine technology
	- 60% credit go to engine. 
	- Normalized complexity - 
	- Additional failure modes. civil aviations have further imrpovements. 

* Airbus ZEROe: Replace kerosyne to hydrogen. 
	* Turboprop, blended wing body, turbofan. 
	* Fuel cells are being  used. 

* Aerodynamics improvement
	* Higher AR - less induced drag
	* Boeing 777x - outerwing would fold. 
	* 알바트로스 - AR 15, L/D 23
		* Shoulder has locking mechanism

# Deep space Network
Profile of deep space communications capability 
- deep space communications capability
- Voyager 
	- 158AU away에 있음. 
	- using X band
- Link budget equation - 10^30 magnitude
	- link budget equation for radio communications
	- Eb/N0, signal-to-noise ratio. 
- JPL still predicts

# General statements in tech evolution 
* Technology taxonomy matrix
	* Matter, Energy, Info, Value, Organisms - technical values
	* Fintech, Biotech 
* Human population and technologiclal milestones  
	* x(t) = (1+r) 
	* Technology rate per yar - growing faster than human population. 
* matter and energy tech. about **6%** per year improvement. 
* Information technology growth much faster - **65%**
* ==Why do machines improve slower than information systems?==
* Information-based technologies 
	* Impedence matching - electronic engineering concept
		* When improve a machine, upstream and downstream connect. change propagation. 
		* Information system - don't need impedence matching. power is too slow. 
		* Slower technology progress. 

* Computing
	* **When will the singularity come?**
	* future the technology improve itself? 
* All the techs were improved by humans, but singularity - double exponential. 
* Technology makes human obsculate. 
	* y axis - calculations per second per $1000
	* **Energy consumption**
	* super computer - heat. 
	* human brain is 10^6 more efficient in energy. 

Beware of unexpected side effects of technology
- greatest accomplishments of 20th century. NAE 
- NAE grand challenges in the 21st century 

Dystopia or Utopia?
* AI will take over the world. 
	* AI as a human augmentation. 

Space colonization -- 안씀. 
Space settlement -- New term!
- defense technology - specifically military intelligence technology. 
- Tech forcasting  -- nop. robust 
- Space explorations - Rough numbers 24 bil$ NASA 100 bil$ - video game. 
- How to select and figure a matrix. 
	- Technology by itself has no value. 

Who is at the table? - chief tech officer, strategy, finance(CFO) - Most powerful person in Airbus
