# PRISMA
* Goal: to produce a review of a field in the most unbiased and systematic way as possible 
* systematic as possible. 
* Specify the geographical location of yor tudy
* identify the key concepts ofyour study
* Search the words using Web of Science and Google Scholar - Web of Science is recommended. conservative.

* Web of Science으로 전체 참고문헌 목록 내보내기 
* Fabricate different excel sheets with title. 

Phase 1 - record identification: google scholar, databasel
Phase 2 - Remove and exclude not related 
Phase 3 - More than 200 is too broad 100~max 300 

* make a README file - explain yor methods processes including the key words
* Holistic review를 쓰기 위한 방법론임. 

* Systematic reviews를 위한 방법임.  

# Meta Analysis
* Fixed/Random effects model
* Robust, Longitudinal data model. 
* Particular useful for medical studies and other studies that have disputed claims. 
* Meta analysis requires the basic understanding of statistics. 

# Structure
**Abstract**
150-250 words
1 sentence on the importance (general sentence)
1 sentence on the research question 
1 sentence on the theories
1-2 sentences on the method
1-2 sentences on the findings
1-2 conclusion/policy implications

ex) some populations are more marginalized than others - more specifically married immigrants are more marginalized than others. (Don't start married immigrants right away) Justify why you are focusing on married immigrants. 
Married immigrant people are particularly marginalized in Korea despite korea being one of the most digitalized countries in the world. 

Following this line of thoughts, this tudy asks its research questions: How do digital access, skills, and usage relate to married immigrant's life?

**2.4. Past studies conducted on this topic**
**2.5. Research questions or hypotheses**
* Despite the numerous studies done on the digital marginalization, There are several gaps in the literature. 
* Research question have question mark
* hypothesis is period
