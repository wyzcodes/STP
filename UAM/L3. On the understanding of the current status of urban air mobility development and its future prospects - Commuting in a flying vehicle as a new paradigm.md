* Five areas of interests: technology, infrastructure, services, societal consideration, policy
	* meet the specific aeronautical requirements on safety, security, robustness level, certification 
* TRL(Technical Readiness Level)
	* UAM Maturity Level(UML)
		* NASA UAM Coordination and Assessment(UCAT) developed
		* Maturity assessment of a UAM system

* **Technology**
	* Propulsion system: electric engines
	* Battery storage
	* Autonomous capabilities of the vehicle
* **Infrastructure**
	* Vertistops(vertiport) : Location, Design, Size
	* CNS(Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance)
	* Seamless UAM Operation (Multi-modality), integration with current ATM 
* **Services**
	* Cost, vehicle range, obstacles, terrain 
	* ODM, On-demand aerial mobility 
* **Societal consideration**
	* Noise
	* Visual disruption 
	* Privacy 
* Regulation
	* US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), European Aviation Safety Agency(EASA)
	* VTOL vehicle certification process

# Technology 
**Vehicle Configuration**
* Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) is considered to be the most relevant implementation of UAMs
	* STOL are also considered as an option
* Electrical Vertical Take-off and Landing vehicles
**Propulsion system**
* Distributed electric propulsion with the new design of VTOL vehicles
* Alternative fuel is a trending research topic in the aviation field. 
	* UAM is not considering alternative fuels, since it is expected that electrical battery technology will be mature enough. 
	* * Noise and emissions are constraints (Societal)
**Autonomous vehicles**
* Environment & Economic impact
	* ODM using utonomous vehicles
* Control system, Autonomous guidance
* Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) flight regulations
* Geo-fencing, Obstacle avoidance, Collision avoidance technologies
**Communication and Navigation**
* Adaptation of 5G
	* Security 
	* Aeronautical adaptation 
**Air traffic Management**
* Existing ATM will not be able to deal with the increase of air traffic demand, so all aviation authorities (FAA, Eurocontrol, CAAC etc) are working on UTM and U-Space concept
* UTM network management and separation services
* Departure and arrival scheduling
* Continuous trajectory management for separation
* Seamless integration with traditional operations
* the extension of UTM with Airborne trajectory management
* Transform helicopter routes for UAM usage

# Concept of Operations
* SESAR Exploratory Research project CORUS developed U-space concept
	* Communication: operator-operator, vehicle-vehicle, operator-Network manager
* Data share
	* Airspace share, 
	* Shared information among Remote Pilot in Command (RPIC)
* Airspace 
	* X, Y, and Z space

# Urban mobility 
**Network Design**
* Take off and landing areas (TOLA)
	* Ground spaces of verticl take off and landing
	* Directly relate to UAM demand rate, travel time 
* Not based on practical experience

* Societal constraints: Location need logical and cheaper solutions for UAM operations, noise, and air pollution 
* Integration of TOLA network to create multi-modal network and services
	* Mobility as a Service: MaaS
