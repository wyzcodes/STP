#LiteratureReview #UAM 
# Intro 
**Gartner's Hype Cycle** : flying autonomous vehicles are in innovation trigger phase, but are expected to reach the peak of inflated expectations soon. 
**Historical development of urban air mobility**
* 1940s, VTOL capability 
	* US and Europe ceased operations in late 1960s to mid-1970s
* Helicopter based passenger transportation
	* Small niche e.g. New York, Sao Paulo, Mexico City, Monaco
**Stakeholders**
* Aeronautics, technology, ground transportation, start-ups financed by equity investments
* Start-ups and established companies from the aviation and automotive industries are active in the field of UAM
**Regulations**
* Aircraft certification e.g. Pursued by EASA 
* 
* Possible policies and market regulation
**Infrastructure** *as a transportation*
* [[UTM]]: UAM Traffic Management 
	* specific project: under the umbrella of U-Space^[SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2018. Single programming document 2019-2021 (Edition: 01.00) [Publications Office of the European Union]. www.sesarju.eu/U-space. Shamiyeh, M., Bijewitz, J., Hornung, M., 2017. A review of recent personal air vehicle concepts. In: Aerospace Europe 6th CEAS Conference.]
**Public acceptance and user adoption**

# Vehicle design and Technological requirements
* A market study commissioned by NASA ^[Booz-Allen, Hamilton, Inc, 2018. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Market Study. https://ntrs. nasa.gov/search.jsp?R¼20190001472. Bosson, C., Lauderdale, T.A., 2018. Simulation evaluations of an autonomous urban air mobility network management and separation service. In: 2018 Aviation Technology, Integration, and Operations Conference. Symposium Conducted at the Meeting of AIAA. Atlanta, Georgia.]
	* High production expectation
	* predicts a near-term demand in the U.S. of 55,000 daily trips for air taxis and airport shuttles, served by 4100 aircraft.
## Aircraft Requirements for UAM 
* [[Top-level aircraft requirements]](TLARs): Requirements
	* Range
	* Seat capacity
	* Cruise speed
* External boundary conditions
	* Hover Efficiency
	* Cruise Efficiency
	* Maintenance Costs
	* Direct Operating Costs
* Further important design drivers
	* Max. Size/Dimensions
	* Max. Noise Emission
## UAM vehicle concepts and classification 
* Distributed electric propulsion (DEP) 
	* VTOL & Fixed-wing cruise operation 

# Regulatory aspects
## Certification
**EASA(2019.07.02)** Special Condition Vertical Take-Off and Landing Aircraft (SC-VTOL-01) 
- ==CS-23 construction (찾아볼것)==, certification regulations
- Land safely after a critical malfunction in the propulsion system --> Requires "Enhanced VTOL"

**EASA department for eVTOL and Special Concepts** (2019.04~)
* Special Condition^[easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/SC-VTOL-01.pdf]
* [[AMC]](Acceptable Means of Compliance) 
* autonomous and pilotless UAM 

**U-space concept**^[SESAR Joint Undertaking. U-space. https://www.sesarju.eu/U-space. 
[[U-space]]: enabling framework to support routine unamanned aerial system(UAS)/UAM Operations, ATM and air navigation service(ANS) providers and authorities] 

## Policies and market regulation 
* Transport system faces severe regulation 
	* Strong infrastructure dependencies - high risk of natural monopolies, face strict policies
* **Legitimacy on market regulation**^[Schulz, N., 2003. Wettbewerbspolitik: eine Einführung aus industrie€ okonomischer Perspektive. Neue € okonomische Grundrisse. Mohr Siebeck.] (읽어보면 좋을 것 같은데 독어 논문임.)
	1. Natural monopoly
	2. Externalities
	3. Information asymmetry()
* Price, Quality, Quantity regulation for modes of transport^[Sheshinski, E., 1976. Price, quality and quantity regulation in monopoly situations. Economica 43 (170), 127. https://doi.org/10.2307/2553202]

# Infrastructure requirements
[[Intermodal connectivity]]
## Ground Infrastructure
(=VTOL infrastructure, Vertiports)
**Ground infrastructure placement**
1. rooftops
2. barges over water
3. inside highway cloverleafs
4. on top of existing ground-transport infrastructure 
기존 헬기 인프라의 응용, UAM의 디자인에 맞게 축소된 형태로 예상됨. 

**No need of en-route infrasturcture**
e.g.) gates and vehicle taxi times
-> UTM 관제의 역할이 중요. 버티포트 사용 및 루트 컨트롤을 중앙 기관에서 제어해야 함.
