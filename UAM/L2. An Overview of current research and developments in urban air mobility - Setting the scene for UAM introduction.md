#LiteratureReview #UAM 
## Intro 
**Gartner's Hype Cycle** : flying autonomous vehicles are in innovation trigger phase, but are expected to reach the peak of inflated expectations soon. 
**Historical development of urban air mobility**
* 1940s, VTOL capability 
	* US and Europe ceased operations in late 1960s to mid-1970s
* Helicopter based passenger transportation
	* Small niche e.g. New York, Sao Paulo, Mexico City, Monaco
**Stakeholders**
* Aeronautics, technology, ground transportation, start-ups financed by equity investments
* Start-ups and established companies from the aviation and automotive industries are active in the field of UAM
**Regulations**
* Aircraft certification e.g. Pursued by EASA 
* Possible policies and market regulation
**Infrastructure** *as a transportation*
* [[UTM]]: UAM Traffic Management 
	* specific project: under the umbrella of U-Space^[SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2018. Single programming document 2019-2021 (Edition: 01.00) [Publications Office of the European Union]. www.sesarju.eu/U-space. Shamiyeh, M., Bijewitz, J., Hornung, M., 2017. A review of recent personal air vehicle concepts. In: Aerospace Europe 6th CEAS Conference.]
**Public acceptance and user adoption**

## Vehicle design and Technological requirements
* A market study commissioned by NASA ^[Booz-Allen, Hamilton, Inc, 2018. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Market Study. https://ntrs. nasa.gov/search.jsp?RÂ¼20190001472. Bosson, C., Lauderdale, T.A., 2018. Simulation evaluations of an autonomous urban air mobility network management and separation service. In: 2018 Aviation Technology, Integration, and Operations Conference. Symposium Conducted at the Meeting of AIAA. Atlanta, Georgia.]
	* High production expectation
	* predicts a near-term demand in the U.S. of 55,000 daily trips for air taxis and airport shuttles, served by 4100 aircraft.
### Aircraft Requirements for UAM 
* [[Top-level aircraft requirements]](TLARs): Requirements
	* Range
	* Seat capacity
	* Cruise speed
* External boundary conditions
	* Hover Efficiency
	* Cruise Efficiency
	* Maintenance Costs
	* Direct Operating Costs
* Further important design drivers
	* Max. Size/Dimensions
	* Max. Noise Emission
### UAM vehicle concepts and classification 
* Distributed electric propulsion (DEP) 
	* VTOL & Fixed-wing cruise operation
